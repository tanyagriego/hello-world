# hello-world
Hello World assignment for Liftoff (Launch Code). 
I'm Tanya, Software Developer in the making. This is my first GitHub assingment for the Liftoff program. I have basic experince with GitHub as I used it during my courses (Code 201 and Code 301) at Alchemy Code Lab. I'm enjoying the review and learning how to make commits through the webiste as I have only used the command line.
